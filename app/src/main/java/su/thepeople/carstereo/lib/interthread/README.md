# Interthread Helper Code

It's somewhat cumbersome to communicate between threads. The code in this subdirectory is meant
to help with this.

The `InterthreadAPI` class is the main helper. It's meant to allow interthread messaging to appear
as simple function calls to the message sender.  See this file for more info.

This subdirectory also contains the interthread API definitions, and some helper classes.
